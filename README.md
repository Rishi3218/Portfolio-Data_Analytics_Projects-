# ⚡ Data Analytics Portfolio  
### Turning Data into Business Decisions

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists
Most portfolios showcase tools.  
This repository demonstrates **analytical judgment**.

It contains end-to-end data analytics projects built to answer real business questions:
- What is happening in the business?
- Why is it happening?
- Where is value being created — or quietly destroyed?
- What decisions should leaders take next?

Every project here follows a disciplined analytics lifecycle:

**Business Objective → Data Validation → Analysis → Insight → Recommendation**

This is analytics built for **real business environments**, not academic demos.

## 🎯 What I Optimize For
I don’t optimize for visuals.  
I optimize for **clarity, financial truth, and decision impact**.

Across these projects, I consistently focus on:
- Framing the *right* business problem before analysis
- Validating data before trusting conclusions
- Designing KPIs that expose risk, not hide it
- Translating insights into actions leaders can execute

---

### 🔹 Project 3: E-Commerce Profitability & Margin Diagnostic Analysis  
**Tools:** Excel, Python, PostgreSQL, Power BI  

**Core Business Problem**  
📈 Revenue was stable, but **profit margins were stagnating and revenue quality was declining**

Leadership concern:
> “If revenue is growing, where is the money being silently lost?”

This project focuses on **profitability diagnostics**, not growth at any cost.

---

#### 📌 Scope & Context
- **Grain:** Order-item level  
- **Volume:** ~75.9k transactions  
- **Time Period:** Jan 2023 – Dec 2024  
- Dataset validated through a formal **data quality and integrity assessment**
- KPIs deemed reliable for executive decision-making

---

#### 🔍 What I Did
- Audited pricing, cost, discount, and return data in **Excel**
- Performed exploratory and diagnostic analysis in **Python** to:
  - Segment margin bands
  - Identify structural low-margin orders
  - Attribute losses to root drivers
- Built reusable analytical views in **PostgreSQL** for:
  - Loss-making orders
  - Low/negative margin revenue exposure
  - Category-level profitability risk
- Designed an **executive Power BI dashboard** highlighting:
  - Margin stagnation trends
  - Discount vs margin relationships
  - Category-level loss concentration
  - High-revenue but low-quality orders

---

#### 💣 Key Findings
- Overall margins plateaued at **42–45%** with no upward trend
- ~**30% of orders are structurally low-margin**
- **44.5% of orders are loss-making**
- **~$33M in losses driven by pricing and cost issues**
- Discount intensity has a strong negative relationship with margin
- Loss exposure varies significantly by product category

---

#### 🎯 Business Impact
- Shifted focus from revenue growth to **revenue quality**
- Identified pricing and cost governance as the **largest recoverable lever**
- Enabled targeted discount guardrails and pricing reviews
- Provided a roadmap for **margin recovery without revenue collapse**
